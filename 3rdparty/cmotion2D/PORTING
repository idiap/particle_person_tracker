		    PORTING Motion2D TO OTHER PLATFORMS

Read this file if you want to port Motion2D to a new platform or C++
compiler.  If you come across any problems, feel free to send mail to
Motion2D@irisa.fr

			     REQUIREMENTS

The new platform needs no specific requirements. But if it is not a 
Unix system things can be complicate. Porting to other Unixes is generally
straight-forward.

Motion2D requires that your C++ compiler supports templates. The compiler 
must recognize the .cpp extension. .

			       PATCHES

Please send us the patches you had to make so we can add them to the
code base; then we can support the new platform in an orderly manner. 
(We want Motion2D to run on as many platforms as possible, but _not_ if that
involves incompatible patches for the same platform floating around the
net.) 


			 PORTING INSTRUCTIONS

In the configs/ directory you will find several build configuration
files for all platforms supported by Motion2D. You can generate your own
config files by hand. The content of such a file is very simple. You just
need to specify the compiler and the associated compiling options.

1) Create your own configuration file in the configs/ directory.

2) Run the configure script to create your new makefiles.


Make a unified diff (diff -u) and send the patch and your new 
configuration to Motion2D@irisa.fr

For most Unix varieties, that's all.  Some may need some include file
tweaks.  Good luck, and again, feel free to send mail to 
Motion2D@irisa.fr
