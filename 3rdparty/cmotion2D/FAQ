   1. Who is IRISA? 

      Irisa (http://www.irisa.fr) is a publicly funded research laboratory with
      a staff of 370, including 150 full-time research scientists or teaching
      research scientists and 115 postgraduate students. INRIA, the CNRS, the
      University of Rennes 1 and INSA Rennes are all partners in this mixed
      research unit.

      Twenty research projects or actions are centered around four major
      scientific topics, i.e. networks and systems- software engineering and
      symbolic computation - man-machine interaction, images, data, knowledge -
      simulation and optimization of complex systems.  These generic themes
      find their application in many fields, resulting in interdisciplinary
      cooperation with other leading professionals from both the academic and
      the industrial world, in areas such as telecommunications, multimedia,
      transport, genome science, emerging technologies applied to health,
      environment etc.

   2. Who is VISTA? 

      Vista (http://www.irisa.fr/vista) is one of the Irisa's research
      projects. Vista research work is concerned with image sequence analysis
      and active vision. More precisely, we address two broad issues: analysis
      of physical phenomena for providing image-based or scene-based
      motion-related measurements, and for investigating recognition and
      interpretation of temporal events; perception and control of automated or
      robot systems, for handling manipulation, tracking, navigation,
      surveillance or exploration tasks.

   3. What kind of licenses exist for Motion2D? 

      The Motion2D toolkit is available under two different licenses: The
      Professional Edition for commercial use, and the Free Edition for
      developing free/open source software under the Q Public License. There is
      more information about the QPL at the Trolltech web site
      (http://www.trolltech.com/qpl).

   4. What are the differences between the Professional and the Free Edition of
      Motion2D?

      You may write commercial/proprietary/non-free software only if you have
      purchased the Professional Edition. The library itself is the same. With
      the commercial edition, you also get technical support and
      upgrades. Motion2D for Microsoft Windows is only available as
      Professional Edition.

   5. I don't want to give away my source code. What do I do? 

      Then you need the Motion2D Professional Edition. 
      Please contact Motion2D@irisa.fr

   6. Can I charge for my application? 

      If you have the Professional Edition: Yes, of course. If you use
      the Free Edition your software must be freely distributable
      and you must include the source. 

      The Free Edition is intended for free software. We realize
      that CD-ROMs cost money to produce, for example, so you
      can charge a copying fee. 

   7. Where can I find Motion2D? 

      The latest version of Motion2D Free Edition can be downloaded from
      http://www.irisa.fr/vista/Motion2D. 

   8. I want to port Motion2D to a new platform. What do I do? 

      If the new platform is POSIX-like System, it's simple. Read the file
      PORTING for details.

   9. I found a bug and I need it fixed! 

      We try to support the developers using the Motion2D Free Edition as well,
      and we take all bug reports seriously, no matter who they come from. But,
      of course, when there's too much to do, our customers have higher
      priority.

  10. What kind of image input/output are provided?

      The CMotion2DImage class is only provided for convenience in order to
      build the Motion2D example programs. Therefore, image input manipulations
      are only supported for MPEG2, PNG and PNM file format. Image output
      manipulations are restricted to PNG and PNM file format The different PNM
      formats are PGM P5 and PPM P6.
