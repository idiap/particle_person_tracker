The Vista research team (Irisa / Inria Rennes) (http://www.irisa.fr/vista)
is pleased to announce the release of Motion2D version 1.3.11.1.

Motion2D is a multi-platform object-oriented library to estimate 2D parametric
motion models in an image sequence. It can handle several types of motion
models, namely, constant (translation), affine, and quadratic models. Moreover,
it includes the possibility of accounting for a global variation of
illumination. As you know, the use of such motion models has been proven
adequate and efficient in issues such as optic flow computation, motion
segmentation, detection of independent moving objects, object tracking, or
camera motion estimation, and in numerous application domains, such as dynamic
scene analysis, video surveillance, visual servoing for robots, video coding,
or video indexing.  Motion2D is an extended and optimized implementation of the
robust, multi-resolution and incremental estimation method (exploiting only the
spatio-temporal derivatives of the image intensity function) we defined several
years ago (J.-M. Odobez and P. Bouthemy, Robust multiresolution estimation of
parametric motion models. Journal of Visual Communication and Image
Representation, 6(4):348-365, December 1995).  Real-time processing is
achievable for motion models involving up to 6 parameters (for 256x256 images).
Motion2D can be applied to the entire image or to any pre-defined window or
region in the image.

Motion2D is released in different versions: 

1. Motion2D Free Edition: version of Motion2D available for development of Free
   and Open Source software only (no commercial use). It is provided free of
   charge under the terms of the Q Public License found in the LICENSE.QPL
   file. It includes the source code and makefiles for Linux, Solaris, SunOS,
   and Irix.

2. Motion2D Professional Edition: version provided for commercial software
   development. This version also supports Windows 95 and NT. For questions
   regarding purchase and pricing (royalties) for the Motion2D Professional
   Edition, please contact us at Motion2D@irisa.fr
