			  INSTALLING Motion2D


You may need to be root, depending on the permissions of the directories
where you choose to install Motion2D.


1.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	cd <install_directory>
	gunzip Motion2D-x.y.z.tar.gz	# uncompress the archive
	tar xf Motion2D-x.y.z.tar	# unpack it

    This creates the directory <install_directory>/Motion2D-x.y.z 
    containing the files from the main archive.

    Make a symlink from Motion2D-x.y.z to Motion2D:

	ln -s Motion2D-x.y.z Motion2D


2.  Building.

    This step compiles the Motion2D library, and builds the example programs.

    Type:

	cd <install_directory>/Motion2D-x.y.z
	./configure

    This will configure the Motion2D library for your machine. 
    Run ./configure -help
    to get a list of configuration options. Read PLATFORMS for a
    list of supported platforms.

    To create the library and compile all examples:

	make

    If your platform or compiler is not supported, read PORTING.  If it is
    supported but you have problems, see http://www.irisa.fr/vista/Motion2D


3.  The online HTML documentation is installed in
    <install_directory>/Motion2D-x.y.z/doc/html/ 

    The main page is <install_directory>/Motion2D-x.y.z/doc/html/index.html



That's all. Motion2D is now installed.
